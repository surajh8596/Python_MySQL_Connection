# Python MySQL Connection
- Python can be used in database applications.
- One of the most popular databases is MySQL.
- Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.
- In this notebook we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".
- Using PIP to install "MySQL Connector" - **pip install mysql-connector-python**
- MySQL should be installed and PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.
